## Description.

With a team, an assemblage was constructed with various material to create a still life image. This image was 'creatively' reconstructed using pure CSS and html. This project demonstrates a working knowledge of CSS and HTML as well as basic design principles including framing, open-compositions, overlap and continuity, abstraction, etc. CSS animations were implemented throughout the page to create movement.
